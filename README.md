## Problem Statement

College students often struggle with stress, anxiety, loneliness, and burnout, yet many hesitate to seek help due to stigma, lack of accessibility, or the absence of a supportive community. Existing wellness solutions can feel impersonal, overwhelming, or disconnected from students’ day-to-day experiences.

Orbit aims to solve this problem by creating a safe, engaging, and student-focused digital wellness ecosystem that combines AI companionship, habit-building missions, emotional tracking, and anonymous peer support.
